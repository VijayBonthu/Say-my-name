Technical Documentation: FastAPI Application

Introduction
This technical documentation provides an overview of a FastAPI application designed to manage student records and phonetic pronunciations. The application facilitates various operations such as creating student records, updating records, retrieving records based on filters, managing user feedback, and more. It is built using Python and leverages the FastAPI framework for creating RESTful APIs.

Installation
The following steps outline the installation process for the FastAPI application:

Clone the Repository: Clone the repository containing the FastAPI application code to your local machine.

Install Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal.

Database Configuration: Configure the database connection details in the database.py file.

Run the Application: Start the FastAPI application by running uvicorn main:app --reload in the terminal.

Overview
The FastAPI application consists of the following components:

Main Script (main.py): The main script serves as the entry point for the FastAPI application. It initializes the FastAPI app, defines API endpoints, and starts the UVicorn server.

Model Definitions: The models.py file contains SQLAlchemy model definitions for the database tables used in the application.

Database Connection (database.py): The database.py file establishes the database connection using SQLAlchemy and provides a function to obtain a database session.

Request Models (p_model_type.py): The p_model_type.py file defines Pydantic models for request payloads used in various API endpoints.

Utility Modules: Additional utility modules such as Split_word.py and different_languages.py provide functionality for splitting words and handling different languages, respectively.

API Endpoints
The FastAPI application provides the following API endpoints:

Create Student Record: POST /createpost endpoint allows creating a new student record. It accepts a JSON payload containing details such as student name, course, and intake.

Update Student Record: PUT /update endpoint enables updating an existing student record. It accepts a JSON payload with updated student details.

Get Student Records: GET /getRecords/ endpoint retrieves student records based on various filters such as student ID, name, course, year, etc.

Submit User Feedback: POST /userfeedback endpoint allows users to submit feedback. It accepts a JSON payload containing the student ID and feedback message.

Manage Phonetic Selection: The selection endpoint (POST /selection) manages phonetic selections. It updates existing selections or creates new ones based on user input.

Error Handling
The FastAPI application implements error handling to ensure robustness and reliability. It utilizes HTTP status codes and exception handling mechanisms to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to clients.

Security and Permissions
The application implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow connections from specified origins. Access control mechanisms can be configured to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles and permissions.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this technical documentation provides an overview of a FastAPI application designed for managing student records and phonetic pronunciations. By following the installation instructions and understanding the API endpoints, users can effectively utilize the application to perform various operations related to student management and feedback submission.
